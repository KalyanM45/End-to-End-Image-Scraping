# End-to-End-Image-Scraping

The "Image Scraper" is a Flask web application that allows users to search for images on Google and download them directly to their local machines. The project leverages web scraping techniques to fetch the image URLs from Google search results and then download the images to a specified directory.

# About

About
In the era of the internet, images play a crucial role in various applications, including web development, data analysis, machine learning, and content creation. However, obtaining a large set of images related to a specific topic or keyword can be time-consuming and challenging.

The motivation behind the "Image Scraper" project is to simplify the process of collecting images for a given search query. By creating a user-friendly web interface, users can easily search for images and retrieve them without the need to manually visit multiple websites and download images one by one.
